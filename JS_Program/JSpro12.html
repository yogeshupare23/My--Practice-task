        <pre>/*
            IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScricpt
            function that runs as soon as it defined.

            It is a design pattern which is also known as Self-Executing Anonymous
            Function and contains two major parts. The first is the anonymous function 
            with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator(). This prevents 
            accessing variable within the IIFE idion as well as polluting the global scope.

            The second part is creating the immediately executing expression(), through
            which the JavaScript engine will directly interprct the function.

           /*
           - Avoid Creating Global variable and Functions
           - As it doesn't defind variable and function globally so there will be no name conficts
           - Scope is limited to thet particular function
           */
