        <h3>var, let and const</h3>
        <pre>
            <strong>var:-</strong>  The scope of the declared with var is its current execution,
            which is either the enclosing function declared outside any function, golbal.
            
            <strong>let:-</strong>  let allows you to variables that are limited in scope to the
            block, statemant, or expression on which it is used.

            <strong>const:-</strong>  This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either
            golbal or local to the block in which it is declared. Golbal constant do not become
            properties of the window object, unlike var variables. An initializer for a constant
            is required; that is, you must specify its value in the same statemant in which it's declared
            which can't be changed later.
